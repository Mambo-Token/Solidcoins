# $CASH Solidcoin
## $CASH solid memecoin is real decentralized digital cash  
## $CASH solidcoin on Kaspa KRC-20 is a stabilized memecoin sold at a determined price.  
### $Cash is not pegged on the USD, but sold at it's 21 moving average towards Kas.  
This reference price serves as a price cap reference, not a peg.  
You should not pay much more for $Cash as the here published current reference price.   
$Cash can fall below this price if there is a heavy selling of circulating $Cash.  
The $Cash community treasury will occasionally partially buy up heavy price dumpbs with collateral from sales.  
This should keep $Cash in a reliabe price range to use it for daily life payments.  

## Current reference sell price:  
1CASH = 1.00 USD / 0.08xy Kas 21d ma = xy Kas  (August 18, 2025)  will be updated soon.....

## Inflation protection!  
The sales price of $Cash increases every month 0.5-1% towards USD.  
Examples: First month prices: 1$Cash = 1 USD. Seont month: $Cash = 1.01 USD. etc.  

## Buy $CASH here:  
## Kaspa.com (pay with Kas without slippage with limit orders.
## $FRANC will soon be avaiable on https://kspr.exchange 
$Franc will be in pools with other solidcoins like $China, $Cash and Memecoin $Mambo  
### We will then consider to list $Franc on the other dexes too.  

## The Goal of $CASH  
The goal of $Cash and other solidcoins is to make using stablecoins obsolete.  
The goal is to replace the need of stablecoins to about 80-90%.  
The goal is to be part of the movement to take back the control over money used for daily life payments into the hand of people, decentralized.
While Mambo is private, the concepts of solidcoins are easy and can be copied and imitated by others - and we would like to see that.  
The fact that anybody can launch his/her own solidcoin - makes it decentralized.  
It's like anybody can create a mememcoin - that's out of central control. So are solidcoins, since they are not stablecoins.
The free market then  will decide in a decentralized way wich solidcoins are used.  
It's all a matter of trust. Why i.e. do ppl trust so heavy in USDT. It was build up over years of not being frauded.  
If people have the choice to choose between different coins managed by private teams, that can be considered as decentral, since it's the free market, and not a central entity which decides what to use.  
And they can be replace by others if things do not work as they should.  
The main goal is to put $Cash into a smart contract controlled DAO, making our management no longer necessary.  

## Price of $CASH  
### At Launch: 1 $CASH Solidcoin = 1 USD in Kas 21d MA.  (= 21 days moving average of USD/Kas.)  

## The Logo of $CASH
We are really proud of this Logo. It's the vertically flipped Kaspa Kas logo, with the complementary colors. 
It symbolizes a coin running on the ultimate L1 Pow cryptocurrency which is less volatile towards USD and sofar ideal to be used as digital Cash for everybody.  It depends on Kaspa's superiority of technology.

## $CASH treasury, liquidity and collateral:  
The funds from sales serve as collateral to support the price of $Cash.   
A part will be used for real dex liquidity pools.  
Following cryptocurrencies are taken as collateral:  
About 50% Kaspa $Kas.  
The other 50% we will OG memecoins on Kaspa KRC-20:  
We consider $Nacho, $Keke, $Kasper, $Pepe, $Mambo, $Madmax, $Apes, $Kenobi, $Whales and others, if they are avaiable at Dexes or marketplaces at good prices.   
The fact that $Cash is partially backed by mememcoins makes it crystal clear that it is not a stablecoin.  
Collateral will be used to buy into price dumps to support the price of the token.  
 
## Circulating Supply or Total Supply, Marketcap illusion   
Reserves of $Cash are not in circulation and should not be calculated for Marketcap.  
Reserve accounts:  will be updated soon ...
Even $Cash in a big DEX LP token/token pools shoul not be calculated as being in circulation, as those pools are balances.  

## Risk of investing in $CASH solidcoin
- the general risk involved with cryptocurrencies  
- if the price of $Kas and the memecoins from the collateral treasury falls heavily, this may cause $Cash price to fall too, since their would not be enough buying power to support it.  
- inability of the Mambo managment team to react in time.  
- other not mentioned risks, unknown factors.  

## Transpareny - $Cash managment accounts:  
Account: .... will be updated soon. 

## Roadmap or $Cash:    
We aim to make $Cash and our other solidcoins over time as decentralized as possible.  
We plan to implement market maker trading robots - once Kaspa has smart contracts.  
We plan to write the whole token managment into smart contracts.  
We plan to make $Cash and other solidcoins working completely trustless.   
In the beginning, it must be managed unto the prescribed direction.  
We plan to create a sort of DAO - but most so called DAO are a farce, that's just a form of plutocracy (whalescracy), still better than centralized stuff. We plan to make ourselves finally superfluous.  
...  
Next steps: If enough $Cash are sold into circulation, we can open an LP with stablecoins on real Dexes.  
First we will open LP's with other solidcoins and continue to sell it on Kaspa.com at fixed limit sell orders.  
We hope that a Dex will soon make a mixed AMM/limit orders orderbook Swap. This would finally make the managament of all stablecoins and of our solidcoins much easier with much less liquidity necessary to hold it stable.  
What is really needed, is not just another old scool AMM Dex, but a AMM Dex combined dynamically with limit buy and sell orders.  
This is the minimum requirement for a good DEX!  
In 2022 zlall.com on zilliqa proved that such a dex can be made and it functioned smootly, even on a L1.  
How does it come, that devs are so blind to the fact on how much benefit a mixed AMM / limit order DEX would be, replacing the need of Cexes for trading.  
Cexes in future should solely be useful for fiat-crypto bridges.
