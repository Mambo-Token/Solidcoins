Historical background of the name Rupya (Rupee):  

The Indian Rupee (₹) gets its name from the Sanskrit word "rūpya" (रूप्य), which means "wrought silver" or "something shaped" (from rūpa = form or shape).
Historical Origin:The term was first used for silver coins introduced by the ancient Indian ruler Sher Shah Suri in the 16th century (1540–1545).
His coin, called the "rupiya", was a silver coin weighing 178 grains (about 11.5 grams) and became the precursor to the modern rupee.
Before that, the word "rūpya" appeared in ancient Indian texts (like the Arthashastra) to refer to stamped silver.

Etymology Breakdown:  
Word Language Meaning  
Rūpya Sanskrit "Silver" or "shaped/stamped metal"  
Rūpa Sanskrit "Form" or "beauty"  
Rupiya Persian/Hindi The silver coin name  

So, "rupee" literally means "silver coin"—a name that stuck even as the currency evolved through Mughal, British, and modern Indian eras.
