# $CAFE Solidcoin on Kaspa KRC-20 (Kasplex protocol)
(whitepaper v. 1.0, 11/2024)

## Why and what is $CAFE ?

The initial price of $CAFE is oriented on the price of 1 Expresso  
standing on a coffee bar in Rome and Paris.  
Its a hommage to the biggest coffee cuture countries Italy and Fance.  

You get 0.12 Cafe per mint.  
1 $Cafe = 8.33 mints  (costs about 8.5 $Kas)  
1 $Cafe on sales cost about 6 - 8.5 $Kas   
1 Espresso on a bar costs about 1 - 1.5€  
The price of Kas at deployment of $CAFE was about 0.16 usd or 0.168€.  
8.33 Kas x 0.168 € = 1.40 € = 1 $CAFE.  
Easy.

## The Goal of $Cafe is to be used for payments on Coffee bars and Restaurants.  
It can be used instead of a fiat stablecoin and it is much more fun to do so.  
It should be fun to pay. You can now pay your coffee with $CAFE.  
You enjoy your coffee already while paying it.  
You can even mint your $Cafe to pay your coffee - yet we recommend to buy it on Marketplaces and Dexes to support the price long term.  

## Kaspa - instant ultra low cost decentralized payments
Thanks to the most advance POW GhoastDag technology of Kaspa, it is finally possible to be used as daily payments currency.  
Kaspa is the end of centralized control over money.
And Solidcoins are using this huge advantage and make payments even more convenient with unique tickers.

## $CAFE helps for mass adoption of the use of cryptocurrency in RWA (real world application/asset).
in the most primordial way: as currency for payment.

## Solidcoin concept - not a stablecoin and not a meme coin  
$Café is a solidcoin and explicitly not a stablecoin and not a memecoin.
It's designed to cushion the volatility of $Kas in relation to fiat currencies.
It's capped at the mint price of 8.33 mints per 1 $Cafe,
but it can fall below this price on marketplaces. 
This makes it behave like oscilating in a narrow range below the cap.
This automatic stabilization mechanisme caused by the mint price cap and the market price which is deteminded by demand and supply helps to hold $Cafe in a low volatile price range.
It should grow in value as $Kas goes up, as we expect it to do long term.
If the marketprice of $Café falls below the treasury value, it can be bought up to higher levels.

## Why you should buy $Cafe and not mint
1. Normally you should get a better price on marketplaces than to mint
2. If you buy $Cafe the funds from the $Cafe sales wallet will flow into the $Cafe community treasury wallet.
3. Buying means you fund the treasury of the coin you invest in with collateral. You help maintain the value of your investment.
4. Funds from sales can be used for liquidity pools.
5. We will not make ugly fund raising campaigns for liquidity - instead the market does it simply by demand and supply.

## Tokenomics of $CAFE
Total supply: 100 Billion  
Premint: 90 Bilion  
To mint: 10 Billion  
Tokens per mint: 0.12  
Mints possible: 83.33 Billion  

This makes clear that $Cafe was not designed to be outminted. 
The minting serves as a price cap - and we do not expect it to be outminted within next decade. 
It would need more Kas than there are Kas in existenc -  
that means the amount of the whole Kas supply would have to circulate about 3x through $Cafe mining. :-)  
Very unlikely or impossible. haha.  
The minting helps although for decentralized micro spreading of the coin.  

The huge balance maybe usefull to pair with other solidcoins in future liquidity pools on dexes.

## Important: Circulating supply
Only tokens minted and sold can be considere to be in circulation.
The most part maybe never used - but we do not plan to burn it, since it can be used for heavy low volatile liquidity pools.  
Marketcap calculation with total supply make no sense. Only with circulating supply.
Formula: circulatng supply x 8.22 kas should be the cap, marketprice may be lower.

## Sales and allocations:
There is no closed presale and no team preallocation.  
Wait, wait, writing this - no I am giving me 1000 $Cafe as reward for creating this wounderful solidcoin and conception.  
Nothing more. Thats almost nothing.

## $Roadmap - outlook
We aim to bring people into real decentralized world, not the hypocritical pseudo web3 / Cex controlled and big brother (monitored by gov tyrants).w
We encourage coffee bars and restaurants and online shops and fund raising platforms (like buy me a coffee) to accept $Cafe as payment.  
This would heavily help for mass adoption in RWA - real world application.  
Help spread the news of this next era money. Use it, accept it, pay with it share our posts.

The cex vultures are licking the asses of the totalitarian anti freedom anti crypto govs and fascist Wef.  
We do not plan to list $cafe on any cex, and they will not want to have pure decentralized money - because they are cex, not dex.  
And if they would want ot offer $Cafe for trading, they will have to buy it (or mint it) like anybody else.
