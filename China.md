## Why $China, what is $China Solidcoin?  

$China solidcoin is not a stablecoin, but a stabilized collectible memecoin.  
It's a decentralized memecoin currency with low volatility.  
The goal is to be used like a stablecoin.  
The goal is to be used for payments and to store funds aimed to be used in cryptocurrencies.  
$China brings more decentralization to the people.  
$China aims to facilitate on-boarding of people for using decentralized cryptocurrencies.  
$China helps to bring people the the most powerful POW cryptocurrency Kaspa $Kas.

## Where to buy $China?  

It can be bought on Marketplaces and soon on DExes:  
[Kaspa.com](https://kaspa.com/?ref=3Lt9YofQ)  
...
## How it works:  
It's that is as: Fix the sales price. It' like a price cap.  
But unlike stablecoins, it can fall below this price from people selling it.  
The treasury wallet funds will buy it up if possible to a range of 10-20% of the sales price.  
So it's held in a stable range. Btw, thats how good memecoins shoul be managed.  
More about that in the solidcoin concept paper.  

## Collateral of $China  
Sales funds are used to build up liquidity and collateral.  
$China is backed by $Kas (coming from sales or market maker actions)  
and it can be partially backed by top OG memecoins like $Nacho $Keke $Kasper $Mambo, $Whales and others.  
It's not excluded to take real trusted stablecoin as part of the collateral.  
At the time of writing December 2024, there is no trusted stablecoin yet on KRC-20.  

## The Logo of $China  
The logo is the well known and loved logograph Á¶è Fu, meaning blessing, happiness.  

## Roadmap  
If $China finds a broader acceptance we may go further with following:  
We plan to implement full DAO mechanisme once smart contracts are implemented in Kaspa.  
We plan to make $China as trustless and decentralized as possible over time.
We encourage people to become personal on-boarding points into $China and $Kas.
We plan to implement trading robots to buy up dips, if collateral allows.  
We plan to develop an automated fixed rates exchange between different solidcoins and stablecoins.  

## Risks:  
General risk of cryptocurrencies.    
Risk of collateral loosing in value. This then may lead to $China go below the aimed price range.
Human errors.
