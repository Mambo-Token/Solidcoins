<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mambo-Token/Solidcoins/refs/heads/main/logos/Rock-Logo.png" width="340" height="340">

## The $Rock token is an Index token of the native OG Memecoins of KRC-20 Kasplex on Kaspa.  
$Rock index 20-40 of top KRC-20 Memecoins.  
The start price is calibrated to 100 Kas per $Rock.  

## Why $Rock
The $Rock KRC-20 OG Memecoin Index (RocKOMi or Rock-Index)  
honors the decication, work, financial sacrifices and campaigns of all those early OG KRC-20 Memecoins  
deployed since June 30, 2024 and September 15, 2024, the start of the most unique Memecoins in whole cryptospace.   
As the statistis shows, only about 5% of over 2000 tokens deployed in this first year survived.  
It's a pity for those nice tickers lost by to expensive minting parameters. The tickers cannot be reproduced.  
The Rock-Index honors dedication and although focus on decentralization.  

## The mission of The $Rock Index Coin:
Similar to $Whales, the mission of The $ROCK token is:  
Emphasizing the uniqueness of all native KRC-20 Memecoins and tickers.  
Remembering the real ethos of why at all cryptos were created and what the Ethos of Kaspa is:  
DECENTRALIZATION.  
We consider the run of the top 30 tokens to be listed for money on CEXes is like prostitution against the idea of decentralization.  
Because of that, only really top OG Token of the top will be taken from beginning in the index. Others will have first to prove that they create authentic volume on DEXES.  
The trading volume of CEXes is 95% marketmaker.  
It's not fair against not Cex listed tokens to occupy the first 30 places because of free marketmaker bot trading volume.  
That means, we may favour token beyoun rank 30 and such, with good DEX engagment.  

 ## Criteria to be on the $Rock-Index:
 The following are not strong rules, but guidelines:  
- one of the top tokens on kas.fyi - with DEX engagment.  
- be a day 1 or month 1 deployed OG token.  
- Deployed more than 8 month ago.
