<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mambo-Token/Solidcoins/refs/heads/main/logos/Rock-Logo.png" width="340" height="340">

## The $Rock token is a native OG KRC-20 Memecoin on Kaspa Kasplex protocol.
$Rock was deployed at minute 3 of opening of the KRC-20 world:  
2024-09-15 14:03:13   

### Tokenomics:  
Total supply: only 28700 $Rock  
Preminted: 24000  
Minting: 4700 tokens at 0.0001/ Mint.  
1 $Rock = 10000 mints.  
The high mint costs reflect the extreme scarcity of $ROCK.  
......
### How the preminted $Rock are used:  
- They are openly and fair sold on Marketplaces from 10 Kas upwards.  
- They are put in LP's on Dex'es for fair sales and distribution.
- A big part will be in LP's with $Whales and other heavy tokens.   
- They are used as reward tokens for staking.
- No preallocation. Zero. 0%!   

### Funds from sales:  
Funds from sales are uses for Liquidity Pools, price support and funding staking rewards.  

## Why $Rock
The $Rock KRC-20 OG Memecoin1
honors the dedication, work, financial sacrifices and campaigns of all those early OG KRC-20 Memecoins  
deployed since June 30, 2024 and September 15, 2024, the start of the most unique Memecoins in the whole cryptospace.   
As the statistis shows, only about 5% of over 2000 tokens deployed in this first year survived.  
It's a pity for those nice tickers lost by to expensive minting parameters. The tickers cannot be reproduced.  
The Rock memecoin honors dedication and focuses on decentralization.  

## The mission of The $Rock:
Similar to $Whales, the mission of The $ROCK token is:  
Emphasizing the uniqueness of all native KRC-20 Memecoins and tickers.  
Remembering the real ethos of why at all cryptos were created and what the ethos of Kaspa is:  
DECENTRALIZATION.  

$Rock is dedicated for trading on DEX'es and Marketplaces.
