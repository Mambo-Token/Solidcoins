## Why $Rock
The $Rock KRC-20 OG Memecoin1
honors the decication, work, financial sacrifices and campaigns of all those early OG KRC-20 Memecoins  
deployed since June 30, 2024 and September 15, 2024, the start of the most unique Memecoins in whole cryptospace.   
As the statistis shows, only about 5% of over 2000 tokens deployed in this first year survived.  
It's a pity for those nice tickers lost by to expensive minting parameters. The tickers cannot be reproduced.  
The Rock-Index honors dedication and although focus on decentralization.

Similar to $Whales, the mission of The $ROCK token is:  
Emphasizing the uniqueness of all native KRC-20 Memecoins and tickers.  
Remembering the real ethos of why at cryptos were created and what the Ethos of Kaspa is:  
DECENTRALIZATION.  

$Rock is dedicated for trading on DEX'es.
