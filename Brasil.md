# $BRASIL is a KRC-20 Kaspa Solidcoi

## Why $Brasil?
Brazil experienced in the last 15 years a 300% inflation towards USD.  
Compared to daily life prices this number is much bigger, 
as the USD lost a lot of value itself in this time frame.  
$Brasil is a demonstration of how a currency can be creation with inflation protection.  
$Brasil is a decentralized crypto currency for all Brazilian people.  
It runs on the best crypto technology Kaspa which allows for instant free p2p payments.  
The special inflation protection mechanism of Mambo Solidcoins will be applied.  

Fiat-pegged stablecoins don’t protect against inflation.
The USD itself lost over 50 % of its purchasing power in the last 15 years.
That’s why Mambo Solidcoins like $Brasil increase ~1 % per month by design,  
so your money finally stops melting and actually keeps (or grows) its real value.


## Tokenomics
$Brasil is follows the elastic supply principle.  
As demand increases, the circulating supply increases.  
This helps to hold $Brasil in a useful stable price range.  
Totol max supply: 900 Trillon. 
Only the circulatibg, sold part schould be counted for mc.
1 Billion tokens can be minted.  
Do not mint! You will get it much cheaper to buy.  
This minting fraction is just toprevent anybody from selling $Brasil to high.  
1 mint gives 0.005 $Brasil. 1 $Brasil needs 200 mins.    

Traditional stablecoins pegged to fiat only protect you from volatility — not from inflation.
The USD itself lost ~50–60 % of its purchasing power over the last 15–20 years.
That’s why we created Mambo Solidcoins: the price slowly rises ~1 % per month, designed to preserve and even grow your real purchasing power over time.
