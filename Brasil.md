# $BRASIL is a KRC-20 Kaspa Solidcoi

## Why $Brasil?
Brazil experienced in the last 15 years a 300% inflation towards USD.  
Compared to daily life prices this number is much bigger, 
as the USD lost a lot of value itself in this time frame.  
$Brasil is a demonstration of how a currency can be creation with inflation protection.  
$Brasil is a decentralized currency for all Brazilian people. 
The special inflation protection mechanism of Mambo Solidcoins will be applied.  

Fiat-pegged stablecoins don’t protect against inflation.
The USD itself lost over 50 % of its purchasing power in the last 15 years.
That’s why Mambo Solidcoins like $Brasil increase ~1 % per month by design,  
so your money finally stops melting and actually keeps (or grows) its real value.



Traditional stablecoins pegged to fiat only protect you from volatility — not from inflation.
The USD itself lost ~50–60 % of its purchasing power over the last 15–20 years.
That’s why we created Mambo Solidcoins: the price slowly rises ~1 % per month, designed to preserve and even grow your real purchasing power over time.
