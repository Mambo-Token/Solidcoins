# Solidcoins
Solidcoins are a new kind of cryptos - made for decentralized payments and collections

Solidcoins aim to replace the fiat stablecoins completely - making the tyrannical destructiv oppresion of the centralized regulators obsolete.
Solidcoins are NOT stablecoins - in no means, the are not pegged on fiat shit coin money or other assets.
But solidcoins are less volatile than typical Memecoins  or utilitycoins - even if some of them can be considered as collectible memecoins too.  
Some solidcoin are sold at a fixed price range with $Kas or with fiat money.  
  
Read the the details here of $Gold, $Cafe and $Franc to learn more about the solidcoin concept.  

Mambo is preparing the Solidoin concept whitepaper.

Its a hommage to the biggest coffee cuture countries Italy and Fance.  

1 $Cafe = 8.3 mints  
1 $Cafe = 6-8.5 kas on sales.

## $Bonds: very heavy Solidcoins  

making payments of big amounts easy countable, serves as a long term store of bigger capital.

.-.-.--.-.-.-.-.    
$China - in preparation  

$Brasil - in preparation  

Both can replace their currency partially.   
.....  

Very heavy and rare collectible solidcoins & memecoins:  
.....  
$Eagles , $Eagle $King $Whales $Rock $XMAS and $Yeshua  

are a mixture between memecoins, rare collectibles and heavy solidoins.  

$XMAS: the ideal gift for Christmas.  
$XMAS is a memecoin with similarities to solidcoins, specially because it's scarce.  

1 $XMAS = 50-200 Kas

.

DO NOT MINT $COINS or other soldicoins. The price maybe much worse, or if similar, you do not support the coin value if you mint instead of buying it.

1 Kas = 100 Coins on sales (like Kas cents)  
1 mint Kas = only 0.0001  
(this was made as a joke with 0.0001% of total supply, only those you do not DYOR will mint it at their own blame).  
Its like some of the copper cents who are much more expensive to mint than they have value.
