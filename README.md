# Solidcoins
Solidcoins are a new kind of cryptos - made for decentralized payments and collections

Solidcoins aim to replace the fiat stablecoins completely - making the tyrannical destructiv oppresion of the centralized regulators obsolete.
Solidcoins are NOT stablecoins - in no means, the are not pegged on fiat shit coin money or other assets.
But solidcoins are less volatile than typical Memecoins - even if some of them can be considered as collectible memecoins too.

Mambo is preparing the Solidoin concept whitepaper.

Meanwhile read more about them on the website:

Solidcoins deployed on Kaspa KRC-20:

**$Gold: the most prestige Solidcoin:**

The first real **digital $GOLD**:

$Gold intial price about 1/1000 of 1 ounce of Gold at 2500 USD at 0.17 Kas (September 2024).
= 0.06 $Gold per mint (1 Kas)

1 $Gold = 16.6 Kas

$Bonds: very heavy Solidcoins - 

making payments of big amounts easy countable, serves as a long term store of bigger capital.

$XMAS: the ideal gift for Christmas.  
$XMAS is a memecoin with similarities to solidcoins, specially because it's scarce.  

1 $XMAS = 50-200 Kas

$CAFE : initial price oriented to the price of 1 Expresso standing on a coffee bar in Rome and Paris.
Its a hommage to the biggest coffee cuture countries Italy and Fance.

1 $Cafe = 8.3 mints

Very heavy and rare collectible solidcoins & memecoins:
.....  
$Eagles , $Eagle $King $Whales $Rock $XMAS and $Yeshua 

are a mixture between memecoins, rare collectibles and heavy solidoins.


Mambo considers them as the best currencies toghether with $Gold on KRC-20.
Very exciting tokens.

$Coins - a lightwight solidcoin for massive retail micropayments.

DO NOT MINT $COINS:

1 Kas = 100 Coins on sales (like Kas cents)
1 mint Kas = only 0.0001
(this was made as a joke with 0.0001% of total supply, only those you do not DYOR will mint it at their own blame).
Its like some of the copper cents who are much more expensive to mint than they have value.
