# Solidcoins  

First of all, we are running since 2021 a proof of concept project with our soldicoins, how easy it is, to stabilize the price of a token.  
After this years, we have proofed, that it is even with micro funds possible, to hold a coin in a price range.  
Most useful tool for this is a DEX or swap with limit buy orders functionality.
We run a small fixed rates exchange and had solidcoins an a AMM/limit orders mixed Dex in 2021-2023. As this chain back then fell behind the top tech, we finally found Kaspa.  
We wait for Dex'es with funitonalities of limit orders, where we best manage the solidcoins.  
And we plan in future to make a almost completely dao  Exchanges. For this we nee help of coders with dedication to decentralization.  
----  
It should be widely aknowledge that it's not complicated to may reliable cryptocurrencies. Only evil powers make it complicated.  
Money and currency is a matter of trust.  It falls in value, when trust in it falls.  
Solidcoins are a new kind of cryptos - made for decentralized payments and collections.  
Solidcoin are solid Memecoins, that means, they are not designed to pump up, but to be in a practical stable solid and reliable range.  
Solidcoins aim to replace the fiat stablecoins completely - making the tyrannical destructiv oppresion of the centralized regulators obsolete.  
Solidcoins are NOT stablecoins - in no means, the are not pegged on fiat shit coin money or other assets.  
But solidcoins are less volatile than typical Memecoins  or utilitycoins.  
Solidcoins can be considered as collectible memecoins too, a nice way to pay, like gold or silver coins, but digital.    
Some solidcoin are sold at a fixed price range with $Kas or with fiat money dma's.

More Infos folow.

.....  

Very heavy and rare collectible solidcoins & memecoins:  
.....  
$Eagles , $Eagle $King $Whales $Rock $XMAS and $Yeshua  

are a mixture between memecoins, rare collectibles and heavy solidoins.  

$XMAS: the ideal gift for Christmas.  
$XMAS is a memecoin with similarities to solidcoins, specially because it's scarce.  

1 $XMAS = 50-200 Kas

.

DO NOT MINT $COINS or other soldicoins. The price maybe much worse, or if similar, you do not support the coin value if you mint instead of buying it.

1 Kas = 100 Coins on sales (like Kas cents)  
1 mint Kas = only 0.0001  
(this was made as a joke with 0.0001% of total supply, only those you do not DYOR will mint it at their own blame).  
Its like some of the copper cents who are much more expensive to mint than they have value.
