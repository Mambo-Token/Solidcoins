# $Gold: - the most prestige Solidcoin  

## The first real digital $GOLD: 
### Layer 2 EVM Ca: 0xcfdCec0827399Fe8FeC014d9399f2c327e6e2399  
(only this one is the real one! on EVM).  
$Gold has pools on:   
👉 [KSPR DEX:](https://app.kspr.exchange?ref=Mambo)  
Gold-Xmas  coming: Gold-Kas, Gold-Rock  
👉 app.Kaspafinance.io  
Gold-Xmas  
   
$Gold's intial price was about 1/1000 of 1 ounce of Gold at anticipated 2800 USD at 0.168 Kas (September 15, 2024).  
2800USD/1000/0.168 Kas = 16.67 Kas / $Gold  
1 $Gold = 16.67 Kas  
16,67 Kas for 1 $Gold is the cap.  
You should not pay much more for it, since you can mint it at about 17 Kas per 1 $Gold.
---  
Half of supply is for sale on Dex's and Marketplaces. The other half is for minting.
Minting cost:  
= 0.06 $Gold per mint (min. 1 Kas). 
That are 16.67 mints per 1 $Gold, about 17 Kas costs.

The sales price is normally maximum 5-25% lower than the mint price. But market sell offs can bring it temporarely further down.  
We encourage buying instead of minting. We sell limited amounts in the range 13-16.6 Kas, slightly belwo the cap.  
Ideally, there should be more tokens in circulation through sales then by minting to support the price long term.  
### Funds from sales are used for the $Gold coin community treasury account.  
It is used for liquidity pools and to support the price by bying it up, if it's dumped.  

**We strongly reccomend NOT to MINT $Gold**   
but to buy $Gold on Dex's (coming)   
$Gold will soon be on https://kspr.Exchange dex in pool with $Cafe.  
You may get the best fixed price and buy it with Kas on Marketplaces:  
https://Kaspa.com  
KSPR: https://t.me/kspr_home_bot?start=PS8u4w  
    
If you buy it instead of minting, you help to support price and the value of the coin, building up collateral. <br>

**The minting price serves as a ceiling**, to maintain $Gold in these proportion to Kas.  

The future will show whether physical Gold or Kas will perform better , $Gold will follow Kas.  

  

## Tokenomics of $Gold:  

Total supply: 50,000,000,000 <br>
Premint 50%: 25,000,000,000 <br>
Tokens per mint: 0.06 <br>
Mints possible: 416,666,666,666 !!<br>
Tokens to mint 50%: 25,000,000,000 <br>

The huge amount of possible mints makes it quasi an "eternal" price ceiling wall. The price will only go for very short time above the mint price, i.e. in short term high demand or people buy it to hight not having done the dyor. <br>
It is aimed for $Gold to act with low volatility, specially in realtion with $Kas.
The goal is to have the price oscillating in a range 0-30% below the mint cost price of 16.67 kas.
$Gold was created with the intntion to serve as an ideal high value payment currency - using Kaspa's security, decentralization and high speed.<br>
An ideal usecase will be,that $Gold is accepted in online and offline shops as payment currency.<br>
$Gold is globally the first real digital Gold, thanks to Kaspa - which himself should be considered as digital Gold, inspite it's name is Silver. :-).

It will be interesting to watch how the price of $Gold (and Kaspa) in comparision to physical Gold will deveop over time.<br>
We assume that Kaspa (and $Gold) will surpass in price development of Gold.

## Realistic price expectations of $Gold
$Gold is capped at 16,67 Kas (Kaspa). it can easily go lower, if people, specially those who minted it, want to liquidate it. And since the Gold circulating from minting does not contribute to support the price.  
If demand is enough high, Gold maybe about 16,67. With lower demand, it may fall below. We put supportive buy orders on Dex's from the treasury.  
You cannot expect $Gold to go above 16,67 Kas long term. But you an expect $Gold to be a good place to store value and an ideal and beatifull way to pay. The first real digita Gold.  

## Outlook
Once we have smart contract on L2's on Kaspa, we plan to fully automatize with smart contract most of the selling and buying, making it completely decentralized. But for this we nee support of the idea and funds, best to buy into $Gold if you like the idea.

## Why Solidcoins? <br>
Those coins aim to replace completely the need of stablecoins with their problems with anti crypto authorities and regulations, control, freezing threats.
Solidcoins like $Gold and $Cafe are not stablecoins, but collectible memecoins held in a certain price range in relation to Kas, the ultimate decentralized cryptocurrency.  
Solidcoins make payment fun, fast, decentralized, easy offer a kind of investment backed partially by Kas (and other solidcoins or mememcoins).
