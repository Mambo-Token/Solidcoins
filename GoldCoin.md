# $Gold: - the most prestige Solidcoin

## The first real digital $GOLD:

$Gold intial price about 1/1000 of 1 ounce of Gold at 2500 USD at 0.17 Kas (September 2024).
= 0.06 $Gold per mint (1 Kas)  
1 $Gold = 16.6 Kas

The sales price is normally maximum 5-25% lower than the mint price. 

Ideally, there should be more tokens in circulation through sales then by minting to support the price long term.
Funds from sales are used for the $Gold coin community treasury account. 

It can be used for liquidity pools and to support the price by bying up low price offers.

We strongly reccomend **NOT to MINT** $Gold <br>
but to buy $Gold on Marketplaces or here, <br>
to long term support the value of the coins. <br>

**The minting price serves as a ceiling**, to maintain $Gold in these proportion to Kas.

The future will show whether physical Gold or Kas will perform better , $Gold will follow Kas.

The general solidcoin whitepaper is in preparation, as is the $Gold coin whitepaper.

## Tokenomics of $Gold:

Total supply: 50,000,000,000 <br>
Premint 50%: 25,000,000,000 <br>
Tokens per mint: 0.06 <br>
Mints possible: 416,666,666,666 !!<br>
Tokens to mint 50%: 25,000,000,000 <br>

The huge amount of possible mints makes it quasi an "eternal" price ceiling wall. The price will only go for very short time above the mint price, i.e. in short term high demand or people buy it to hight not having done the dyor. <br>
It is aimed for $Gold to act with low volatility, specially in realtion with $Kas.
The goal is to have the price oscillating in a range 0-30% below the mint cost price of 16.67 kas.
$Gold was created with the intntion to serve as an ideal high value payment currency - using Kaspa's security, decentralization and high speed.<br>
An ideal usecase will be,that $Gold is accepted in online and offline shops as payment currency.<br>
$Gold is globally the first real digital Gold, thanks to Kaspa - which himself should be considered as digital Gold, inspite it's name is Silver. :-).

It will be interesting to watch how the price of $Gold (and Kaspa) in comparision to physical Gold will deveop over time.<br>
We assume that Kaspa (and $Gold) will surpass in price development of Gold.

This paper will be updated later on with more fundamentals. Read the introduction text of the solidcoin topic and the $Cafe paper.  

## Why Solidcoins? <br>
Those coins aim to teplace completely the need of stablecoins with their problems with anti crypto authorities and regulations.
Solidcoins are not stablecoins, but collectible memecoins held in a certain price range in relation to Kas, the ultimate decentralized cryptocurrency.
Solidcoins makes payment fun, fast, decentralized, easy offer a kine of investment backed partially by Kas (and other solidcoins or mememcoins)
