# $FRANC Solidcoin
## $FRANC solidcoin on Kaspa KRC-20 is the successor of $Franc "chocolate stablecoin" launched by Mambo back in 2021.
### The new $FRANC is explicitely NOT a stablecoin, but a solidcoin.  

## Mambo is fighting at the core in the battle between centralized tyranny and decentralized solutions.
It was like the european crypto regulators read our 2021 "stablecoin" concept and adapted and implemented rules on June 2024 to ever prevent any entity in EU to launch a stablecoin without them having controll over it.  
BUT: Kaspa is the end of central control over money. Point.  
And so are our solidcoins. We stopped to launch or maintain any kind of stablecoins to escape the destruction of those fascist and help to save a decentralized way for non volatile reliable fast instant payments - the art of having fun to pay.
