# $FRANC Solidcoin  
## $FRANC solidcoin on Kaspa KRC-20 is the successor of $Franc "chocolate stablecoin" launched by Mambo back in 2021.  
### The new $FRANC is explicitely NOT a stablecoin, but a solidcoin.

## The Goal of $FRANC
The goal of $Franc and other solidcoins is to make using stablecoins obsolete.
The goal is to replace the need of stablecoins to about 80-90%.
The goal is to be part of the movement to get take back the control over money used for daily life payments into the hand of people, decentralized.
While Mambo is private, the concepts of solidcoins are easy and can be copied and immitated by others - and we would like to see that.
The fact that anybody can launch his/her own solidcoin - makes it decentralized.
It's like anybody can create a mememcoin - that's out of central control. So are solidcoins, since they are not stablecoins.
The free market then  will decide in a decentralized way wich solidcoins are used.  
If people have the choice to choose between different coins manage by private teams, that can be considered as decentral, since it's the free market, and not a central entity.
And they can be replace by others if things do not work as they should.  

## Roadmap or $Franc  
That being said, we aim to make $Franc and our other solidcoins over time as decentralized as possible.  
We plan to implement market maker trading robots - once Kaspa has smart contracts.  
We plan to write to whole token managment into smart contracts.  
We plan to make $Franc and other solidcoins working completely trustless.   
In thhe beginnin, it must be managed unto the prescribed direction.  
We plan to create a sort of DAO - but most so called DAO are a farce, that's just a form of plutocracy (whalescracy), still better than centralized stuff.  
We plan to make ourselves finally superfluous.  
...  
Next steps: If enough $Franc are sold into circulation, we can open an LP on real Dexes.  
Hopefully there will be Dexes with possibility to open LP's with to tokens of choice. So we could pair two solidcoins in a LP.

## Characteristic and price of $FRANC solidcoin  
Originally $Franc was soft pegged on the price of Toblerone chocolate - correlated to CHF, but with an annual growth rate of abotu 6%.  
That means, it was not really a stablecoin but better. It was collaterized mainly by the base currency of that blockchain.  
We made over 2 years proof of concept, but could not maintain the peg, since the base currency dropped about 90% in value.  
But we maintained a certain price range and stability.  

### The new concept is:  
We abandoned the idea of trying to maintain a peg -  
thus $Franc can at no means be considered as a stablecoin and does not fall under regulatory stablecoin restrictions.  
To make it simple, we no longer refer the sales price to the chocolate price - but we track it for comparision.
At launch of $Franc Solidcoin in December 2024 100g Toblerone costs 2.85 CHF.  

### Price of $Franc:  
At Launch: 1 $FRANC Solidcoin = 1 CHF  
Sell price increases yearly 12%, monthly 1%.  
To calculate the sells price in Kas we will take a 90 days moving average price of $Kas (90d ma),   
We will take an approximate Forex exchange price USD-CHF (21d ma). 
Applying moving averages takes out the hectic and stress from short term volatile spikes and makes $Franc smooth and low volatile.  
The price is adapted weekly. In cases of heavy volatility and big price changes we may adapt the price as it occurs.  
Example:  
Dec 3, 2024:  
$Kas 90d MA (moving average) = 0.1495 USD.  
Forex: 21d MA: USDCHF 0.8808  
**1$ FRANC = 1CHF / 0.8808 USD / 0.1495 Kas = 7.59 Kas**  
Formula: 1 $Franc = 1CHF + 1% increase per month / USDCHF / KASUSD  
Reference sell price increase table:
December 2024: 1 $Franc = 1.00 CHF   
January 2025:  1 $Franc = 1.01 CHF   
,,
July 2025:     1 $Franc = 1.07 CHF  
....   
The fact that we use moving averages makes the price compared to fiat currencies low volatile.  
The sells price is not a peg, it's just the sales price.  
Whether the this price can be maintained or not, depends on the free market price of $Franc and the market price of the collateral of $Franc:  
$Kas and several memecoins, se next paragraph.  

## $Franc treasury, liquidity and collateral:  
The funds from sales serve as collateral to support the price of $Franc.  
A part will be used for real dex liquidity pools.  
Following cryptocurrency are taken as collateral:  
About 50% Kaspa $Kas.  
The other 50% we will buy following OG memecoins on Kaspa KRC-20:  
$Nacho, $Keke, $Kasper, $Mambo, $Jumbo, $Madmax, $Apes, $Kenobi,  (others maybe added, and those mentioned maybe replaced).  
The fact that $Franc is partially backed by mememcoins makes it crystal clear that it is not a stablecoin.  
But in average good times it should be at least similar stable as a stablecoin.  
We will not immediatly try to support the market price, if it falls below the official sales price.  
We will occasionally buy it up, if the collateral allows to do so.
This gives arbitrage traders, investors and speculators the occasion to buy $Franc at a discount.  

## $FRANC solidcoin - better than stablecoins - First currency on Kaspa KRC20 to be used similar to a stablecoin.
What to expext from $Franc. You cannot expect Franc to trade within a narrow range of 0 -2% from the current sales price, like stablecoins do, if they are enough collateralized.  
But you can expect Franc to trade in a range of 0-20% deviation from the sells price. Since there is almost endless supply, the price will rather not go above the sells price, or only in low liquidity spikes. But it can easily fall below the current sales price and remain below for longer time, in a range of up to 20% - 30% lower.
Such dipps can be good occasions to buy it up for speculators.  
The free market will autoamatically move the price towards sales price.
The fact that the sales price get up 1% monthly helps keeping the value of $Franc moving upwards.  
The goal is to beat the creeping inflation.  

## Circulating Supply or Total Supply
It is a big mistake to make marketcap calculations with total supply or $Franc.  
Only sold $Franc should be calculated, not even those put on sales, for having an good measure of the real marketcap.  
That means the real circulating supply (not counting pending offers from us).  
The market supply of $Franc is elastic. 
If demands goes up, more is sold. If demand shrinks, $Franc are bought back using the collateral funds in the treasury.  
This will not happen immediatly, giving speculators time to react earlier than $Franc management.  

## Risk of investing in $Franc solidcoin
- the general risk involved with cryptocurrencies  
- if the price of $Kas and the memecoins from the collateral treasury falls heavily, this may cause $Franc price to fall too, since their would not be enough buying power to support it.  
- inability of the Mambo managment team to react in time.  
- other not mentioned risks, unknown factors.

## The story behind $Franc  
## The original Price of $Franc  
Back in June 2021, when $Franc chocolate stablecoin was launched, it was soft pegged on the price of the famous swiss chocolate Toblerone.  
100g standard Toblerone cost 2.20 CHF back then. To make it more practical and similar to CHF, we decided to soft peg it on:   
0.4545 g Toblerone. 2.20 x 0.4545 = 1.- CHF. That means, at the time of launch, it was exactly 1 $Franc = 1 CHF.  
### Massive inflation although in Switzerland:  
In those 3 years Toblerone price went up 2x first to 2.70 and now 2.85. This was a huge leap from 2.20 to 2.70, caused by the covid scam coup d'Etat insane economical and physical self destruction of economy and civil life, with a lot of fiat money printing to finance their satanic globalist murder agenda. Example of CHF fiat money abuse: financing the protection of WEF criminals in Davos.  
This price increase of Toblerone is a good proof of how much real inflation felt in the last years.  
The New Version of $Franc Solidcoin on #Kaspa is no longer soft pegged on the Toblerone. But we will continue to track the price of it, to compare if our anual inflation protection sales price increase beats the chocolate price developement or not.

## Mambo is fighting at the core in the battle between centralized tyranny and decentralized solutions for low volatile daily life payment currencies.  

It was like the european crypto regulators read our 2021 "stablecoin" concept and adapted and implemented rules on June 2024 to ever prevent any entity in EU to launch a stablecoin without them having control over it.  
BUT: Kaspa is the end of central control over money. Point.  
And so are our solidcoins.  
We stopped to launch or maintain any kind of stablecoins to escape the destruction of those fascist and help to save a decentralized way for non volatile reliable fast instant payments.   
**The art of having fun to pay.**  
That means, solidcoins are not hard pegged on anything, but they are designed in a decentralized way to behave less volatile than most cryptocurrencies.
They are designed to be less volatile towards fiat money than Kaspa itself, but strongly connected to the price development of Kaspa.
