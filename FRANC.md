# $FRANC Solidcoin
## $FRANC solidcoin on Kaspa KRC-20 is the successor of $Franc "chocolate stablecoin" launched by Mambo back in 2021.
### The new $FRANC is explicitely NOT a stablecoin, but a solidcoin.  

## The Goal of $FRANC
The goal of $Franc and other solidcoins is to make using stablecoins obsolete.
The goal is to replace the need of stablecoins to about 80-90%.
The goal is to be part of the movement to get take back the control over money used for daily life payments into the hand of people, decentralized.
While Mambo is private, the concepts of solidcoins are easy and can be copied and immitated by others - and we would like to see that.
The fact that anybody can launch his/her own solidcoin - makes it decentralized.
It's like anybody can create a mememcoin - that's out of central control. So are solidcoins, since they are not stablecoins.
The free market then  will decide in a decentralized way wich solidcoins are used.  
If people have the choice to choose between different coins manage by private teams, that can be considered as decentral, since it's the free market, and not a central entity.
And they can be replace by others if things do not work as they should.  

## Roadmap or $Franc
That being said, we aim to make $Franc and our other solidcoins over time as decentralized as possible.  
We plan to implement market maker trading robots - once Kaspa has smart contracts.  
We plan to write to whole token managment into smart contracts.  
We plan to make $Franc and other solidcoins working completely trustless.  
In thhe beginnin, it must be managed unto the prescribed direction.
We plan to create a sort of DAO - but most so called DAO are a farce, that's just a form of plutocracy (whalescracy), still better than centralized stuff.  
We plan to make ourselves finally superfluous.  
...  
Next steps: If enough $Franc are sold into circulation, we can open an LP on real Dexes.
Hopefully there will be Dexes with possibility to open LP's with to tokens of choice. So we could pair two solidcoins in a LP.

## Characteristic and price of $FRANC solidcoin  
Originally $Franc was soft pegged on the price of Toblerone chocolate - correlated to CHF, but with an annual growth rate of abotu 6%.
That means, it was not really a stablecoin but better. It was collaterized mainly by the base currency of that blockchain.
We made over 2 years proof of concept, but could not maintain the peg, since the base currency dropped about 90% in value.
But we maintained a certain price range and stability.  
### The new concept is:  
We abandon the idea of trying to maintain a peg - thus $Franc can at no means be considered as a stablecoin and does not fall under regulatory stablecoin restrictions.  
But the price of $Franc is still orientated on the price of 100g Toblerone chocolate.
The retail price of 100g Toblerone chocolate in a swiss discount grocery shop went up about 2x in 4 years. 
This makes it resistant to creeping inflation. .... to be completed soon.

## The story behind $Franc
## Mambo is fighting at the core in the battle between centralized tyranny and decentralized solutions for low volatile daily life payment currencies.

It was like the european crypto regulators read our 2021 "stablecoin" concept and adapted and implemented rules on June 2024 to ever prevent any entity in EU to launch a stablecoin without them having controll over it.  
BUT: Kaspa is the end of central control over money. Point.  
And so are our solidcoins.  
We stopped to launch or maintain any kind of stablecoins to escape the destruction of those fascist and help to save a decentralized way for non volatile reliable fast instant payments.   
**The art of having fun to pay.**  
That means, solidcoins are not hard pegged on anything, but they are designed in a decentralized way to behave less volatile than most cryptocurrencies.
They are designed to be less volatile towards fiat money than Kaspa itself, but strongly connected to the price development of Kaspa.
